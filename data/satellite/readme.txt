This directory should contain input data. It is large and binary and thus not included. Instead, a list of files that should be put here is included. You should download the files and put them here yourself (for example, by placing an order on the ESPA system).

For Sentinel-2 imagery, the provided list is that of UUIDs for use with the Python package `sentinelsat`. That list was generated by `sentinelsat` from the `guyana2017.geojson` reference AOI file.
