Data is organised into three subdirectories:
* reference: Point locations of known logged trees.
* satellite: Level-2 satellite imagery (download instructions).
* intermediary: Satellite imagery in various stages of processing.
* output: Space-time cubes around each selectively-logged location.
See readme.txt in each subdirectory for more information.
