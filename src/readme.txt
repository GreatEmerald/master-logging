This directory contains all the scripts produced for the thesis. Most of them have a frontend and a backend.
The root directory contains frontends, which are runnable directly or via `Rscript` for ease of use from within Bash.
The `preprocessing directory contains the functions that the frontends call, and the actual processing is handled there.
The `visualisation` directory contains plotting and analysis on the preprocessed data.
The `bash` directory contains utility Bash scripts.
The `staging` directory contains code that was not used, as well as an example of how to run the whole preprocessing chain.
