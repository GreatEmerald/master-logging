# master-logging
Minor master thesis on selective logging in Bolivia.

The work is organised into three main directories: `data` for input and output datasets (placeholders), `src` for source code and `thesis` for LaTeX documents. The `master` branch should only contain text and reasonably-sized images, there may be other branches for binary data.

For more in-depth descriptions of particular directories, see `readme.txt` files in them.
