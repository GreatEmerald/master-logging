We assessed the effects of logging on total and merchantable bole (i.e., lowest branch at crown base) heights on 952 tropical canopy trees in French Guiana. We observed reductions in both total (mean, −2.3 m) and bole (mean, −2.0 m) heights more than a decade after selective logging. Depending on local logging intensity, height reductions resulted in 2--13 percent decreases in aboveground tree biomass and 3--17 percent decreases in bole volume. These results highlight the adverse effects of logging at both tree and stand levels. This decrease in height is a further threat to future provision of key environmental services, such as timber production and carbon sequestration.},

	abstract = {Managed forests are important landscape components in tropical regions and may contribute to biodiversity conservation. Yet, managing tropical forests sustainably requires an understanding of ecosystem responses to silvicultural interventions. We investigated how silvicultural intervention intensity affects tree species composition and diversity over 30 years in the Brazilian Amazon by comparing them to pre-logging conditions and to an unlogged control. The interventions comprised logging in 1982 and thinning in 1993--1994 and ranged in intensity from 19 to 53\% reduction in the original basal area (BA). Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm were measured on eight occasions in 41 permanent sample plots of 0.25 ha each. Silvicultural intervention intensity influenced both tree species composition and its trajectory within 30 years. In contrast, tree species diversity was not impaired. High intervention intensities (with BA reduction \&gt; 6.6 m2 ha− 1) had a substantial influence on the community of trees (DBH ≥ 10 cm), which did not show signs of return to pre-logging species composition. The reduction of BA through harvesting damage and thinning had a stronger effect on species composition than logging of mature trees itself. Thus, damage should be kept to a minimal level and strong thinning interventions should be avoided. This may enhance ecosystem recovery and maintenance of biodiversity at other trophic levels. Since current permitted harvesting intensities in the Brazilian Amazon are lower than the lowest intensity examined in our study, legal harvesting practices are unlikely to cause substantial, long-term changes in tree species composition.},

@article{grecchi_integrated_2017,
	abstract = {Forest cover disturbances due to processes such as logging and forest fires are a widespread issue especially in the tropics, and have heavily affected forest biomass and functioning in the Brazilian Amazon in the past decades. Satellite remote sensing has played a key role for assessing logging activities in this region; however, there are still remaining challenges regarding the quantification and monitoring of these processes affecting forested lands. In this study, we propose a new method for monitoring areas affected by selective logging in one of the hotspots of Mato Grosso state in the Brazilian Amazon, based on a combination of object-based and pixel-based classification approaches applied on remote sensing data. Logging intensity and changes over time are assessed within grid cells of 300 m × 300 m spatial resolution. Our method encompassed three main steps: (1) mapping forest/non-forest areas through an object-based classification approach applied to a temporal series of Landsat images during the period 2000--2015, (2) mapping yearly logging activities from soil fraction images on the same Landsat data series, and (3) integrating information from previous steps within a regular grid-cell of 300 m × 300 m in order to monitor disturbance intensities over this 15-years period. The overall accuracy of the baseline forest/non-forest mask (year 2000) and of the undisturbed vs disturbed forest (for selected years) were 93\% and 84\% respectively. Our results indicate that annual forest disturbance rates, mainly due to logging activities, were higher than annual deforestation rates during the whole period of study. The deforested areas correspond to circa 25\% of the areas affected by forest disturbances. Deforestation rates were highest from 2001 to 2005 and then decreased considerably after 2006. In contrast, the annual forest disturbance rates show high temporal variability with a slow decrease over the 15-year period, resulting in a significant increase of the ratio between disturbed and deforested areas. Although the majority of the areas, which have been affected by selective logging during the period 2000--2014, were not deforested by 2015, more than 70\% of the deforested areas in 2015 had been at least once identified as disturbed forest during that period.},

@article{dutrieux_reconstructing_2016,
	abstract = {We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984--2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond.},

@article{schneibel_assessment_2017,
	abstract = {Tropical dry forests provide globally important ecosystem services and host exceptionally high biodiversity. These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming.
We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5--8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72\%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70\% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994--1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailed information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics.
We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing.},

	abstract = {Effective monitoring of selective logging from remotely sensed data requires an understanding of the spatial and temporal thresholds that constrain the utility of those data, as well as the structural and ecological characteristics of forest disturbances that are responsible for those constraints. Here we assess those thresholds and characteristics within the context of selective logging in the Bolivian Amazon. Our study combined field measurements of the spatial and temporal dynamics of felling gaps and skid trails ranging from {\textless}1 to 19 months following reduced-impact logging in a forest in lowland Bolivia with remote-sensing measurements from simultaneous monthly ASTER satellite overpasses. A probabilistic spectral mixture model (AutoMCU) was used to derive per-pixel fractional cover estimates of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil. Results were compared with the normalized difference in vegetation index (NDVI). The forest studied had considerably lower basal area and harvest volumes than logged sites in the Brazilian Amazon where similar remote-sensing analyses have been performed. Nonetheless, individual felling-gap area was positively correlated with canopy openness, percentage liana coverage, rates of vegetation regrowth, and height of remnant NPV. Both liana growth and NPV occurred primarily in the crown zone of the felling gap, whereas exposed soil was limited to the trunk zone of the gap. In felling gaps {\textgreater}400 m2, NDVI, and the PV and NPV fractions, were distinguishable from unlogged forest values for up to six months after logging; felling gaps {\textless}400 m2 were distinguishable for up to three months after harvest, but we were entirely unable to distinguish skid trails from our analysis of the spectral data.},

	abstract = {1.  As the role of forestry-based options for reducing or mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is debated by policymakers, there is a need to inform the debate by synthesizing existing information on carbon dynamics in tropical forest systems and by applying this information to a range of possible interventions in forestry. 2.  To investigate the consequences of reductions in logging damage for ecosystem carbon storage, we constructed a model to simulate changes in biomass and carbon pools following logging of primary dipterocarp forests in south-east Asia. We adapted a physiologically driven tree-based model of natural forest gap dynamics (FORMIX) to simulate forest recovery following logging. 3.
Following selective logging, simulated ecosystem carbon storage declined from prelogging levels (213 Mg C ha−1) to a low of 97 Mg C ha−1, 7 years after logging. Carbon storage in biomass approached prelogging levels about 120 years after logging. 4.  The relationship between fatal stand damage and ecosystem carbon storage was not linear, with biomass recovery following logging severely limited by 50--60\% stand damage. 5.  Results from simulations suggest that when 20--50\% of the stand is killed during logging, replacing persistent forest species with pioneer tree species can reduce the site's potential for carbon storage by 15--26\% over 40--60 years. 6.
Reducing fatal damage from 40\% to 20\% of the residual stand, as was the case with a pilot project in Malaysia, was associated with an increase of 36 Mg C ha−1 in mean carbon storage over 60 years. 7.  Efforts to monitor and verify the benefits, either through carbon sequestration in new growth or carbon retention in existing biomass, of offset projects involving tropical forests and natural forest management should focus on above-ground biomass, particularly the large trees. Selection of the most appropriate allometric equations for a site and species is important because of their influence on biomass estimates.},

Using extensive high-resolution satellite analyses, we studied the forest damage caused by recent logging operations and the likelihood that logged forests would be cleared within 4 years after timber harvest. Across 2,030,637 km2 of the Brazilian Amazon from 1999 to 2004, at least 76\% of all harvest practices resulted in high levels of canopy damage sufficient to leave forests susceptible to drought and fire. We found that 16 ± 1\% of selectively logged areas were deforested within 1 year of logging, with a subsequent annual deforestation rate of 5.4\% for 4 years after timber harvests. Nearly all logging occurred within 25 km of main roads, and within that area, the probability of deforestation for a logged forest was up to four times greater than for unlogged forests. In combination, our results show that logging in the Brazilian Amazon is dominated by highly damaging operations, often followed rapidly by deforestation decades before forests can recover sufficiently to produce timber for a second harvest. Under the management regimes in effect at the time of our study in the Brazilian Amazon, selective logging would not be sustained.},

All trees \&gt;25 cm were monitored in 25.4 ha plots of each treatment, each with a subplot of 5.25 ha for trees \&gt;10 cm dbh. The commercial timber volumes in felled trees were 38.9 and 37.4 m3 ha−1 in the RIL and CL plots, respectively, but the extracted volumes were 38.6 and 29.7 m3 ha−1, respectively. Immediately after logging, plots subjected to RIL and CL lost 17\% and 26\% of their above-ground biomass, respectively. Over the 16 years after logging, the average annual increments in above-ground biomass (recruitment plus residual tree growth minus mortality) were 2.8 Mg ha−1 year−1 in the RIL plot but only 0.5 Mg ha−1 year−1 in the CL plot. By 16 years post-logging, the RIL plot recovered 100\% of its original above-ground biomass while the CL plot recovered only 77\%; over the same period, biomass in the control plot maintained 96\% of its initial stock. These findings reinforce the claim that conversion from CL to RIL would represent an efficient forest-based strategy to mitigate climate change under the REDD+ and would be an important step towards sustainable forest management.},

Quantifying disturbance location, extent, severity, and the fate of disturbed biomass will improve carbon budget estimates and lead to better initialization, parameterization, and/or testing of forest carbon cycle models. Spaceborne remote sensing maps large-scale forest disturbance occurrence, location, and extent, particularly with moderate- and fine-scale resolution passive optical/near-infrared (NIR) instruments. High-resolution remote sensing (e.g., ∼1 m passive optical/NIR, or small footprint lidar) can map crown geometry and gaps, but has rarely been systematically applied to study small-scale disturbance and natural mortality gap dynamics over large regions. Reducing uncertainty in disturbance and recovery impacts on global forest carbon balance requires quantification of (1) predisturbance forest biomass; (2) disturbance impact on standing biomass and its fate; and (3) rate of biomass accumulation during recovery. Active remote sensing data (e.g., lidar, radar) are more directly indicative of canopy biomass and many structural properties than passive instrument data; a new generation of instruments designed to generate global coverage/sampling of canopy biomass and structure can improve our ability to quantify the carbon balance of Earth's forests. Generating a high-quality quantitative assessment of disturbance impacts on canopy biomass and structure with spaceborne remote sensing requires comprehensive, well designed, and well coordinated field programs collecting high-quality ground-based data and linkages to dynamical models that can use this information.},

	abstract = {1. Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests. 2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps. 3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0{\textperiodcentered}25 to 6{\textperiodcentered}47 mm year−1, with an average growth of 2{\textperiodcentered}29 mm year−1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species. 4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year−1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year−1). 5. Functional traits explained 19--42\% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species{\rq} response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response. 6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.},

@article{powell_quantification_2010,
	abstract = {Spatially and temporally explicit knowledge of biomass dynamics at broad scales is critical to understanding how forest disturbance and regrowth processes influence carbon dynamics. We modeled live, aboveground tree biomass using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field data and applied the models to 20+ year time-series of Landsat satellite imagery to derive trajectories of aboveground forest biomass for study locations in Arizona and Minnesota. We compared three statistical techniques (Reduced Major Axis regression, Gradient Nearest Neighbor imputation, and Random Forests regression trees) for modeling biomass to better understand how the choice of model type affected predictions of biomass dynamics. Models from each technique were applied across the 20+ year Landsat time-series to derive biomass trajectories, to which a curve-fitting algorithm was applied to leverage the temporal information contained within the time-series itself and to minimize error associated with exogenous effects such as biomass measurements, phenology, sun angle, and other sources. The effect of curve-fitting was an improvement in predictions of biomass change when validated against observed biomass change from repeat FIA inventories. Maps of biomass dynamics were integrated with maps depicting the location and timing of forest disturbance and regrowth to assess the biomass consequences of these processes over large areas and long time frames. The application of these techniques to a large sample of Landsat scenes across North America will facilitate spatial and temporal estimation of biomass dynamics associated with forest disturbance and regrowth, and aid in national-level estimates of biomass change in support of the North American Carbon Program.},

@article{verbesselt_detecting_2010,
	abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes ({\textgreater}0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01--0.07 σ) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1--0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur.},

	abstract = {Near real-time monitoring of ecosystem disturbances is critical for rapidly assessing and addressing impacts on carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and socio-ecological processes. Satellite remote sensing enables cost-effective and accurate monitoring at frequent time steps over large areas. Yet, generic methods to detect disturbances within newly captured satellite images are lacking. We propose a multi-purpose time-series-based disturbance detection approach that identifies and models stable historical variation to enable change detection within newly acquired data. Satellite image time series of vegetation greenness provide a global record of terrestrial vegetation productivity over the past decades. Here, we assess and demonstrate the method by applying it to (1) simulated time series of vegetation greenness data from satellite data, (2) real-world satellite greenness image time series between February 2000 and July 2011 covering Somalia to detect drought-related vegetation disturbances. First, simulation results illustrate that disturbances are successfully detected in near real-time while being robust to seasonality and noise. Second, major drought-related disturbance corresponding with most drought-stressed regions in Somalia are detected from mid-2010 onwards. The method can analyse in-situ or satellite data time series of biophysical indicators from local to global scale since it is fast, does not depend on thresholds and does not require time series gap filling. While the data and methods used are appropriate for proof-of-concept development of global scale disturbance monitoring, specific applications (e.g., drought or deforestation monitoring) mandate integration within an operational monitoring framework (e.g., http://www.fews.net/).},

	abstract = {We combined a detailed field study of forest canopy damage with calibrated Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) reflectance data and texture analysis to assess the sensitivity of basic broadband optical remote sensing to selective logging in Amazonia. Our field study encompassed measurements of ground damage and canopy gap fractions along a chronosequence of postharvest regrowth of 0.5--3.5 years. We found that canopy damage and regrowth rates varied according to the logging method used, either conventional logging or reduced impact logging. Areas used to stage felled trees prior to transport, log decks, had the largest gap fractions immediately following cutting. Log decks were quickly colonized by early successional plant species, resulting in significant gap fraction decreases within 1.5 years after site abandonment. Although log decks were the most obvious damage areas on the ground and in satellite imagery, they accounted for only 1--2\% of the total harvested area of the blocks studied. Other forest damage features such as tree-fall gaps, skid trails, and roads were difficult to recognize in Landsat reflectance data or through textural analysis. These landscape features could be only crudely resolved in the most intensively logged forests and within about 0.5 years following harvest. We found that forest damage within any of the landscape strata (decks, roads, skids, tree falls) could not be resolved with Landsat reflectance or texture data when the canopy gap fraction was {\textless}50\%. The basic Landsat ETM+ imagery lacks the resolution of forest structural features required for quantitative studies of logging damage. Landsat textural analyses may be useful for broad delineation of logged forests, but detailed ecological and biogeochemical studies will probably need to rely on other remote sensing approaches. Until spatial gradients of canopy damage and regrowth resulting from selective logging operations in tropical forests in the Amazon region are resolved, the impacts of this land use on a continental scale will remain poorly understood.},

	abstract = {We combined a detailed field study of canopy gap fraction with spectral mixture analyses of Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery to assess landscape and regional dynamics of canopy damage following selective logging in an eastern Amazon forest. Our field studies encompassed measurements of ground damage and canopy gap fractions along multitemporal sequences of post-harvest regrowth of 0.5--3.5 yr. Areas used to stage harvested logs prior to transport, called log decks, had the largest forest gap fractions, but their contribution to the landscape-level gap dynamics was minor. Tree falls were spatially the most extensive form of canopy damage following selective logging, but the canopy gap fractions resulting from them were small. Reduced-impact logging resulted in consistently less damage to the forest canopy than did conventional logging practices. This was true at the level of individual landscape strata such as roads, skids, and tree falls as well as at the area-integrated scale. A spectral mixture model was employed that utilizes bundles of field and image spectral reflectance measurements with Monte Carlo analysis to estimate high spatial resolution (subpixel) cover of forest canopies, exposed nonphotosynthetic vegetation, and soils in the Landsat imagery. The method proved highly useful for quantifying forest canopy cover fraction in log decks, roads, skids, tree fall, and intact forest areas, and it tracked canopy damage up to 3.5 yr post-harvest. Forest canopy cover fractions derived from the satellite observations were highly and inversely correlated with field-based canopy gap fraction. Subsequent regional-scale estimates of forest gap fraction were derived from the combination of field- and satellite-based measurements. A 450-km2 study of gap fraction showed that approximately one-half of the canopy opening caused by logging is closed within one year of regrowth following timber harvests. This is the first regional-scale study utilizing field measurements, satellite observations, and models to quantify forest canopy damage and recovery following selective logging in the Amazon.},

	abstract = {There is currently a great deal of interest in the quantitative characterization of temporal and spatial vegetation patterns with remotely sensed data for the study of earth system science and global change. Spectral models and indices are being developed to improve vegetation sensitivity by accounting for atmosphere and soil effects. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was developed to minimize soil influences on canopy spectra by incorporating a soil adjustment factor L into the denominator of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) equation. For optimal adjustment of the soil effect, however, the L factor should vary inversely with the amount of vegetation present. A modified SAVI (MSAVI) that replaces the constant L in the SAVI equation with a variable L function is presented in this article. The L function may be derived by induction or by using the product of the NDVI and weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI). Results based on ground and aircraft-measured cotton canopies are presented. The MSAVI is shown to increase the dynamic range of the vegetation signal while further minimizing the soil background influences, resulting in greater vegetation sensitivity as defined by a ``vegetation signal'' to ``soil noise'' ratio.},

Both fully-watered control beds and water-stressed beds were periodically examined with a spectroradiometer calibrated against a reflectance reference of polytetrafluoroethylene. The observed changes correspond to those predicted by stochastic leaf models employed by other investigators (leaf reflection increases in the l.55-l.75μm region as leaf water content decreases). Although the percentage changes in TM bands 1-3 are nearly as great as those found in TM bands 5 and 7, the absolute values of reflectance change are much lower. We believe that these patterns are probably characteristic of a broad range of vegetation types. In terms of phenomena detection, these patterns should be considered in any practical remote sensing sensor scenario.},

	abstract = {* Tropical forest biomass is a crucial component of global carbon emission estimations. However, calibration and validation of such estimates require accurate and effective methods to estimate in-situ above ground biomass (AGB). Present methods rely on allometric models that are highly uncertain for large tropical trees. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) tree modelling has demonstrated to be more accurate than these models to infer forest AGB. Nevertheless, applying TLS methods on tropical large trees is still challenging. We propose a method to estimate AGB of large tropical trees by 3D tree modelling of TLS point clouds.


* Twenty-nine plots were scanned with a TLS in three study sites (Peru, Indonesia and Guyana). We identified the largest tree per plot (mean DBH of 73.5 cm), extracted its point cloud and calculated its volume by 3D modelling its structure using quantitative structure models (QSM) and converted to AGB using species-specific wood density. We also estimated AGB using pantropical and local allometric models. To assess the accuracy of our and allometric methods, we harvest the trees and took destructive measurements.


* AGB estimates by the TLS-QSM method showed the best agreement in comparison to destructive harvest measurements (28.37\% CV-RMSE and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.95), outperforming the pantropical allometric models tested (35.6 to 54.95\% CV-RMSE and CCC of 0.89 to 0.73). TLS-QSM showed also the lowest bias (overall underestimation of 3.7\%) and stability across tree size range, contrasting with the allometric models that showed a systematic bias (overall underestimation ranging 15.2 to 35.7\%) increasing linearly with tree size. The TLS-QSM method also provided accurate tree wood volume estimates (CV RMSE of 23.7\%) with no systematic bias regardless the tree structural characteristics.


* Our TLS-QSM method accounts for individual tree biophysical structure more effectively than allometric models, providing more accurate and less biased AGB estimates for large tropical trees, independently of their morphology. This non-destructive method can be further used for testing and calibrating new allometric models, reducing the current underrepresentation of large trees in, and enhancing present and past estimates of forest biomass and carbon emissions from tropical forests.

	abstract = {Mapping deforestation using medium spatial resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat) is increasingly shifting from decadal and annual scales to sub-annual scales in recent years, but this shift has brought new challenges on how to account for seasonality in the satellite data when detecting deforestation. A seasonal model is typically used to account for seasonality, but fitting a seasonal model is difficult when there are not enough data in the time series. Here, we propose a new approach that reduces seasonality in satellite image time series using spatial context. With this spatial context approach, each pixel value in the image is spatially normalised using the median value calculated from neighbouring pixels whose pixel values are above the 90th percentile. Using Landsat data, we compared our spatial context approach to a seasonal model approach at a humid tropical forest in Brazil and a dry tropical forest with strong seasonality in Bolivia. After reducing seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation from the same data using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) method. We show that, in dry tropical forest, deforestation events are detected much earlier when the spatial context approach is used to reduce seasonal variations in Landsat data than when a seasonal model is used. In the dry tropical forest, the median temporal detection delay for deforestation from the spatial context approach was two observations, seven times shorter than the median temporal detection delay from the seasonal model approach (15 observations). In the humid tropical forest, the difference in the temporal detection delay between the spatial context and seasonal model approach was not significant. The differences in overall spatial accuracy between the spatial context and seasonal model were also not significant in both dry and humid tropical forests. The main benefit for using spatial context is early detection of deforestation events in forests with strong seasonality. Therefore, the spatial context approach we propose here provides opportunity to monitor deforestation events in dry tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data.},
